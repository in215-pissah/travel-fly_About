### Web 4 Link

For this project, the goal was to create the about page for the Travel-fly website. For this page, I used an id named "**app**" for the body of the about page. I also plan to reuse the id name again for the next pages.

The **scss code** for the my app id:

```
#app {
max-width: $content-width;
margin: 0 auto;
}
```

As shown in the **#app** id I used margin : **0 auto** to center the contain of the About Page. Doing this also makes the web page more responsive unlike using margin-left and margin-right. For the website's width to be responsive I used max-width and the length of width I used the variable **$content-width**, which is 980px.
